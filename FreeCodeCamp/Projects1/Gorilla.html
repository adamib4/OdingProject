            "Silverback gorillas live high in the mountains in two protected parks in Africa. They are also referred to as mountain gorillas. Silverback gorillas continually wander through their home ranges of 10 to 15 square miles, feeding and resting throughout the day. Because gorillas are nomadic, they build new nests each day at dusk, constructing them out of bent branches in a tree or of grasses on the ground. Silverback gorillas have long black hair and their thick, shaggy coats help to keep them warm in cold climates."

        <p class="tab">

             "Adult male mountain gorillas are called Silverbacks because of the silver saddle of hair on their backs. Mountain gorillas have a stocky build, with a broad chest, long, muscular arms and wide feet and hands. Their arms are longer than their legs. Gorillas live in groups. Each gorilla family has a silverback as leader who scares away other animals by standing erect on its hind legs, tearing  up and throwing plants, drumming on the chest with its hands or fists, stamping its feet, striking the ground with its palms and galloping in a mock attack on all fours!"

        <h3><b>Males and Females</b></h3>
        <p class="tab" id="Males&Females">
            "Gorillas are the largest apes. Gorilla species are sexually dimorphic, meaning there is a significant difference in size between adult males and females. Adult females weigh about 200 pounds and average around 4 feet tall. Male gorillas are much larger than females, weighing about 400 pounds and growing to 6 feet tall. Males have larger heads than females, due to a crest, or ridge on their skull that serves as an anchor where large jaw muscles attach. Sexual dimorphism is a key piece of gorilla information that helps you understand why only some become silverbacks."
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
            "Only male gorillas become a silverback. Male gorillas are considered mature adults at eight years old, although they are not yet fully grown. They continue to grow and have black hair for the next four years. During this time, they may leave their troops and live alone or join a group of other males of similar age. Male gorillas become silverbacks around the age of 13, when the hair across their shoulders and down their back becomes grayish or white in color. Generally, only silverback males become the leader of a troop."
